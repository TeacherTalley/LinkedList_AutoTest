Front element: 5
Back element: 30
Pop front: 5
Integer list 1: 10 20 30
Pop front: 10
Integer list 1: 20 30
Length of list 1 is 2
List 1 is not empty
Pop back: 30
Pop back: 20
Integer list 1::
List 1 is empty
Integer list 1: 10 20 30
Copy integer list 1 to integer list 2.
Integer list 2: 10 20 30
Pop 2 elements of the front of integer list 2.
Integer list 1:30:
Integer list 2:10 20 30:
Integer list 2 via std cout: 10 20 30:
